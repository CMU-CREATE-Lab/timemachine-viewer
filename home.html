        The plant in this timelapse is a quick-growing variety of <i>Brassica rapa</i> developed by Paul Williams at the University of Wisconsin and commonly called <a href="http://www.fastplants.org/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Wisconsin Fast Plants</a>.  They are widely used in classrooms and in research, because they have a very short generation time and can be grown at a high density in a small space under fluorescent light. <i>Brassica rapa</i> is in the mustard family, and is closely related to broccoli; the clusters of flower buds look like tiny broccoli stalks.
